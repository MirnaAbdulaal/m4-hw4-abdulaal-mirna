        <p>My favourite artist is Madonna because I find her creativity really unique, and her album 'Ray of Light' merges spirituality with electronic music really well, in a way I never saw someone else do before. She is very curious about other cultures and is also very experimental, but I think what I like most about her is that she was very bold in speaking about social issues she cared about.</p> 
    <p>My favourite songs in the album are:
        <ol>
        <li>Frozen</li>
        <li>The Power of Goodbye</li>
        <li>Mer Girl</li>
    </ol>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>Madonna serves as an example of how theatre art can be merged with music, because her performances were always carried out in a way that were more poetic than merely entertainment. To conclude, the main reason why Madonna is such a great artist is because she thinks about her music theatrically.</p>
